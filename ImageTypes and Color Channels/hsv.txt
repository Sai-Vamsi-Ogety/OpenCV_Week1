On the left hand side we have our hue channel which indicates the type of color that we see in a 360 degree format. 
In the middle we have our saturation value which has an indication of how saturated an individual color is and 
on the far right we have the value channel, which indicates only how luminous the channel is. 
You can notice for example in the hue section all the leaf appears to be about the same color, the same shade of dark. 
This is one way that it may be more efficient to operate in the hsv space than the rgb space if for example we want to isolate a particular color. Keep in mind the different color profiles available as you're working through more sophisticated filtering and processing you may find a task nearly impossible to complete in one color space but is trivial in another.
